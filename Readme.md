# Tiny TV ROM Dump Reverse engineering
This device contains an unknown SunPlus 16-bit MCU.

The ROM contents are similar to those described in [the a3400pro repo](https://github.com/AndrewMohawk/a3400pro/blob/9156e07fcd380d5a382f0cc6390aed9eb7c1d8e2/sunplus.py), but different enough since that is for an audio player product.

The ROM is block addressed and blocks are 512 bytes each.

Some light reversing of the format:
